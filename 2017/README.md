# Advent of Code 2017
Solutions for [advent of code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). All of the solutions will be written in python 3. I will try to provide C/C++ solutions as well. Why multiple languages? Because I want to practise my C/C++ skills, but I also want to be on the leaderboard so python is the wise choice.

Most of the programs can be run with
```bash
python3 day_xy.py < input.txt
```

Don't forget to replace the input with your input, since everybody gets a different one.
